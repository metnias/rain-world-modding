## Why?
Because the [original modding wiki](https://rain-world-modding.fandom.com/wiki/Rain_World_Modding_Wiki) has largely fallen into disuse and some pages haven't been updated in upwards of 2 years. 
The modding community has been active in the sanctuary of the Rain World Discord's modding channels and some offshoots for large RW expansions, 
but appears abandoned from the outside. It's time to rectify this.

Want to discuss this project with us? You can find us in the [Rain World Discord](discord.gg/rainworld)'s modding channels.
