# The Official Level Editor

![editorFront](../../../assets/regionDevelopment/levelEditor/editorFront.png)

The Rain World level editor is a powerful tool that allows for the creation of new rooms for the game. It is the same editor the developers used to make all of the rooms for the base game. It takes specially formatted spritesheets and a number of programmed effects and outputs png files that the engine interprets in 3D (as well as an accompanying text file which contains collision and gameplay info).

You can download the level editor from [here](https://ln.sync.com/dl/db7b0cf70/nebg7d6b-qg7gjua7-gjdi94jn-xuvivhw3).



## Basic Features Overview

---



Once you've followed the on-screen instructions for either creating or opening a level, you are presented with the dashboard/preview screen.  From here, you can switch between the different editors, load or save your level, and export it for use in-game.  The preview presented here requires being manually updated whenever changes are made or when you first open a level.  Pressing "1" at any point will bring you back to this screen so you can save your level or switch to a different editor.


It's often best to start by modifying the dimensions of the room to your liking using the level size button before beginning to edit.  You can change this at any time, but because you set the dimensions manually rather than visually, making changes later is more difficult and poses the risk of accidentally deleting a portion of your room if you aren't careful.

From the dashboard you can switch to the [Geometry Editor](Geometry-Editor.html) (for defining the level geometry and collision), the [Tile Editor](Tile-Editor.html) (for customizing the tiles and assets that make up the geometry created in the geometry editor), the [Effects Editor](Effect-Editor.html) (for adding procedural effects like erosion or slime, as well as things like plants or chains), the [Light Editor](Light-Editor.html) (for customizing the light and shadow in your room), or the [Prop Editor](Prop-Editor.html) (for adding additional hand placed props and decals like graffiti).

## Crash Avoidance and Editor Quirks

---

Due to the editor being extremely user unfriendly, you are likely to run into various crashes without warning. This is a list of various things to avoid doing.

### Crashes:

- Do not switch to editing applied effects in the Effects Editor when there are none. The switch will be invisible, and attempting to use the space bar to select something from there will crash the Level Editor.
- Some effects have very specific conditions and cause issues when rendering, Effects include: Thick Roots, and Shadow Plants. these ones can be okayed through until it renders.)
- Be sure to remove tiles from parts of a room that will be removed if you resize the room to cut those areas out, those tiles are still recorded, and will crash renders instantly.
- props are the exact same as above
- Never render with no cameras. It will crash.
- Always move the prop menu into an actual category when you open it, it keeps the last menu used, and crashes if you select any entry that is not a real prop. (EX: it will have the effects menu, or tile menu.)

- If you are using the Mirrored tile placer, in the geometry editor. Placing poles, with the other side of the mirrored brush being outside of the room, will crash the editor.

### Quirks:

- The main menu is a mess when you return from using the Light Editor or the Environment Editor. Just change to any other editor (geometry or tiles, and back to main menu) to clean it. This is not a crash, but will help prevent confusion if you know to expect this.
- To use the Move and Move Mirror tools in the editor, you must first select them, and then move your mouse outside of the room itself, before it will respond to your inputs. Usually you will only need to put your mouse over the editor, but in larger rooms, this is often an issue, as the room is "behind" the menu, and thus only changes tool selection.
- The editor still receives inputs if you only tab out using alt-tab. When viewing another window, it's important to always minimize the editor, because there are many things that can go wrong if you're randomly clicking in the editor.
- (Requires more confirmation) The screen during rendering should usually show the map being rendered, but it may not. In the task manager, The Rain World Editor is under the tab Adobe Projector. Sometimes the reason it is not showing is a second application called "Print driver host for applications". Closing the application seems to fix the issue.
- The window for the application may be too big to fit on screen, and cannot be fixed since reaching the top bar or right clicking cannot be accessed to move the window.



## Demo and Tutorial Videos

Region Developer Kaeporo created a tutorial for creating levels in and out of the level editor:

Mod community member Sacretis also put together a demonstration video, this time covering the creation of a room from scratch to visual polish (massively sped up for the sake of time):
